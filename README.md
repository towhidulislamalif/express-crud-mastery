# Express CRUD Application

## Install Dependencies:
To start, make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer. Then, go to your project folder in the terminal and use the following command to install the necessary project dependencies: `npm install` or `npm i` (the "i" is short for "install").

## Setup MongoDB:
Ensure that you have a MongoDB server running and update the MongoDB connection URL in your '.env' file with the correct values.

## Build the TypeScript code:
To convert the TypeScript code into JavaScript, use the following command to build the project: `npm run start:dev`.

## Start the Server:
To start your server, use the following command: `npm run start`. Alternatively, if you want to run your project in development mode with automatic restarts on code changes, use this command: `npm run start:dev`.

## Access the Application:
Open your web browser and go to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/) to access your application. If you specified a different port in your .env file, use that port instead.

Now your Express CRUD application should be running locally. You can use tools like Postman to test the API endpoints.
